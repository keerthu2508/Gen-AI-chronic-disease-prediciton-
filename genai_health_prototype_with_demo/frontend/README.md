React Native prototype notes:
- Run 'npx react-native init GenAIChronicCare' and replace App.js with this file.
- Install AsyncStorage: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- For offline notifications, use 'react-native-push-notification' or 'expo-notifications' for Expo.
- To enable multilingual regional support, add 'react-native-localize' and i18n library.
